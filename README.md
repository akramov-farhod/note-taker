## Title

NOtaker

## Description

NOtaker is an application like no other. It even takes NO as an input and can create a brand new note. A note can contain a title and have content in the form of text. User could also use NOtaker to delete existing notes. And the best part about it, you don't need a database to make it work. You ask how? Programming Magic!
